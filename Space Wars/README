=============================
A SpaceShip game which consisnt of 6 types of spaceships!, each ship is an subclass for the spaceship class 
which plays the role as an abstract class. the override is only for 1 method - "doAction". the game runs by the spacewars class 
and it continue untill the play press the esc button. 
each game the object passed by the args array are made and the game begin by making a move.
the move mean invoking a doAction method for each object.

=============================
after learning the interface of the game. and all the public method that are being published by certains classes. 
first i worked on the spaceship class untill i could make a first run of the game. after that, i started working on the players.
i can say it was quite fun working and understanding which method to use and decide when to use it. i made the spaceship calss 
as an abstact one and all the types of spaceships was just subclasses that made an override. i barely used super. i really found no
for that in this ex.

=============================
i would like say few things about the ex itself. i think it was too much time consuming but not in term of getting a good knowledge
after putting effort. in short i think it was more understanding how to interact with the method that you already wrote rather than 
actually learn how to use or more deep understanding of inheritance.
