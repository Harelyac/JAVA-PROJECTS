and also return info about the player itself.

Move.java - just a minor class to hold the move properties and then use them for marking the correct sticks.

Competition.java - The main class of the project and even the main class is there. this class resposible
on the game managment. 
from getting arguments and making players untill running the game itself with number
of times which has been given as an argument in the program run.

=============================
about the design, i dont actually understand the exact meaning of this but i will try to say that,
i term of design of code, 
i did interesting stuff with do-while and break with label which i kind of forgot.
so its kinda remind me of things.

i want to say that the pdf was quite understanbable. if you stick to it. you will eventually finish the exercise.

=    Answers to questions   =
=============================
in the game between a random player and a smart one, i thought that the best way to confront a random player,
is to be consistent in the moves that i make. i tried to think of a way to make sure that will make the random 
left with 1 stick left.so smart eventually will win in a nuthshell. 
so i came with an idea to be consistent with the number of marked sticks on board. which means 
either i will make the board consistent with odd amount of sticks or with even amount of sticks. 
in this exercise i odd over even.
